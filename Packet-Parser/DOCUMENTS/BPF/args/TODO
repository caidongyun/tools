# TODO

The CLI processing does not process multiple commands given as a group 
lead by a single hyphen.... case in point -abcd, where -a -b -c -d are 
four different commands. This feature should be implemented. 


The common arguments.... as in
    ./programm 1 2 3 4 --first-command --second-command 
so in above case the common arguments are 1 2 3 4, they go to each
--first-command --second-comand.... so on and so forth, the way they
are now being put forward is not abstract(enough). It should be made abstract.


Infact what I would love to do or see is an STL container which is able to 
process the CLI arguments and provide lots and lots of abstraction. Infact I'm
already working on an implementation but due to lack of time(yes, the same old excuses, excuses) the code base is not getting done at the moment, if you like to work on it just send me a howl at sohail@stupidcomputing.com and I'll(with pleasure) send you the copy of what ever I am able to organize.
